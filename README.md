# V2X Communication Validation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to validate the navigation accuracy and latency estimation for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. We use ADMA Slim as the ground truth and employ sensor fusion algorithms to predict the geographical location of vehicles and pedestrians.

## Objectives
- **Validate Navigation Accuracy**: Ensure the precision of location data in V2X communications.
- **Estimate Latency**: Measure and analyze the delay in data transmission and processing.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Integrate data from multiple sensors to improve location prediction accuracy.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gather data using ADMA SLim and various sensors.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Apply algorithms to combine data from different sensors.
- **Validation**: Compare the predicted locations with the ground truth provided by ADMA SLim.
- **Analysis**: Evaluate the accuracy and latency of the predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **ADMA SLim**: Provides high-precision ground truth data.
- **Sensor Fusion Algorithms**: Used for integrating data from multiple sensors.
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
